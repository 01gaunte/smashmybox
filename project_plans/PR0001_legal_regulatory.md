# PR0001 – Legal, Jurisdiction & Funding

**Status:** On Hold (Concept Validated)
**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** None
**Date:** Jan 2026

---

## Objective

Position SmashMyBox correctly from a compliance perspective, select optimal jurisdiction, and define funding requirements for launch.

---

## 1. Game Mechanic (Clarified)

SmashMyBox is **not** a traditional visible prize pool.

### Core Mechanics
- Each box displays a **fixed face value** (e.g. £10)
- Contributions are **hidden** — users do not see progress
- The box pays out **only when the internal threshold is reached**
- Users receive a notification only when the box is full
- If a contribution causes the box to exceed the threshold:
  - Only the amount required to reach the threshold is allocated to the prize
  - Any **overshoot amount belongs to the house**
- The house also takes:
  - ~1% platform edge
  - A defined charity allocation (creator-selected)

### What This Creates
- A deterministic payout
- A hidden threshold
- A known prize
- A non-random but **uncertain timing** mechanic

---

## 2. Terminology / Classification (Working)

### Preferred Description (Internal)
> *Deterministic prize pool with a hidden fill threshold and overshoot capture*

### Key Characteristics
- Single winner
- Fixed net payout
- No odds, no randomness
- House edge derived from overshoot + fixed percentage

### This is NOT
- A lottery
- A visible sweepstakes
- A traditional betting product with odds

**Note:** Final legal classification deferred until licensing stage.

---

## 3. Net vs Gross Box Value (Decision)

### Decision
Boxes should represent the **net payout to the winner**.

### Example
- Box shows: **£10**
- Winner receives: **£10 exactly**
- Box actually fills to ~£13 gross to cover:
  - Platform edge
  - Charity allocation
  - Taxes / duties

### Rationale
- Cleaner user experience
- No "surprise deductions"
- Face value = truth

---

## 4. Jurisdiction Analysis (High Level)

### Jurisdictions Considered
- UK
- Malta
- Gibraltar
- Isle of Man
- Curaçao
- Alderney / Guernsey
- Anjouan (Comoros)

### Key Findings

**UK**
- High and increasing gambling duty
- No real upside for international operation
- Heavy compliance burden

**Gibraltar / Isle of Man**
- Very reputable
- Very expensive
- Best for established operators

**Curaçao / Anjouan**
- Low cost
- Weaker perception
- Banking friction
- Reputational risk

**Channel Islands**
- Mid-to-high cost
- Scaling fees
- Good reputation

### Decision: Malta is Optimal

**Malta balances:**
- ✓ Regulatory credibility (MGA license recognized globally)
- ✓ Predictable costs
- ✓ EU alignment
- ✓ International player focus
- ✓ Scales cleanly with growth
- ✓ Payment processor friendly
- ✓ Tax efficiency options

---

## 5. Malta – Cost Reality

### Licensing Costs (Annual)
- **MGA B2C licence:** ~€25,000 per year
- **Legal / setup fees:** £10,000–15,000 (one-time)
- **Compliance / audit:** Ongoing operational cost

### Tax Position (High Level)
- **Gaming tax:** 5% on Malta-based players
- **Non-Malta players:** Typically outside scope
- **Corporate tax:** Can be reduced via imputation system
- **Effective rate:** Lower than UK, transparent structure

### Total Launch Capital Required
**Target: ~£40,000**

Breakdown:
- License application & first year: £22,000
- Legal setup & compliance: £12,000
- Working capital buffer: £6,000

---

## 6. Funding Discussion (Initial)

### Target Raise: £40,000

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Seed Round / Angels (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Fastest route to capital
- Flexible terms
- Network benefits from investors
- Allows focus on product, not repayment

**Cons:**
- Equity dilution
- Requires pitch deck & investor relations
- Time investment in fundraising

**Target investors:**
- Friends & network
- Angel investors in gaming/fintech
- Early believers in the concept

#### Option 2: Bank Lending
**Pros:**
- No equity dilution
- Structured repayment

**Cons:**
- Difficult for gaming-adjacent startups
- Requires strong forecasting
- Personal guarantees likely
- Risk appetite needed
- Less suitable for pre-revenue

### Likely Path (When Resumed)
- Small seed round with clear use-of-funds
- License acquisition
- MVP development
- Early traction with test markets

---

## 7. Current Status & Rationale

### Why This is Paused
- Licensing cost is non-trivial (£40k barrier)
- Product is validated conceptually
- Capital raise needs proper focus and timing
- Market timing considerations (2026 landscape)

### Why This Has Legs
✓ Novel but simple mechanic
✓ Clean user promise (net payout)
✓ Social / club / group applicability
✓ Scalable once licensed
✓ International market opportunity
✓ Lower regulatory risk than pure gambling
✓ Differentiated positioning

### Strategic Pause Benefits
- Time to refine pitch & business model
- Observe regulatory changes
- Build network for funding round
- Develop holding page & brand awareness
- Validate interest without capital commitment

---

## 8. Re-entry Triggers

Return to active development when **any** of these conditions are met:

### Funding Route Identified
- £40k capital path is credible
- Investor interest confirmed
- Terms are acceptable

### Market Validation
- Strong pre-commitment from potential users
- Partnership interest from clubs/organizations
- Media/community traction on concept

### Regulatory Clarity
- MGA process becomes clearer/faster
- Alternative lower-cost path emerges
- UK regulatory environment changes favorably

### Personal Readiness
- Full-time commitment possible
- Co-founder identified (optional but valuable)
- Support network in place

---
