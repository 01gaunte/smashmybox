# Version Control Guide

All documents in this project use semantic versioning for tracking changes.

## Version Format: vX.YY

### Integer (X) - Major Changes
Increment the major version (1.00 → 2.00) for:
- Significant strategic pivots or decisions
- Complete restructuring of document
- Major additions that change the scope
- Fundamental changes to approach or methodology

### Decimal (YY) - Minor Changes
Increment by 0.01 (1.00 → 1.01) for:
- Small edits, clarifications, or corrections
- Adding examples or notes
- Formatting improvements
- Minor updates to existing sections
- Progress updates on tasks

## Version Header Template

```markdown
<!--
Version: v1.00
Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
Changelog:
- v1.00 (YYYY-MM-DD): Initial document creation
-->
```

## Examples

3. Include the date of the change
4. Keep the changelog concise but informative
5. Major versions should be rare and significant
